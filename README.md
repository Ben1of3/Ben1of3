- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ben1of3, but you can just call me Ben.
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming, reading, building, coding, tech, music, biking.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript... It only took me 2 weeks to learn Python, I got kind of sidetracked by the global pandemic and impending threat of world war 3 though.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular, anything that gives me a bit of practice to get back into the swing of it.
- 📫 How to reach me: Don't call me, I'll call you.
